This project is a prototype landing page designed as part of an internship assignment, focusing on providing a comprehensive guide for characters within the popular video game, Genshin Impact. The primary objective of this web page is to offer users insights into how specific characters are constructed and how to optimize their builds for efficient gameplay.

The landing page serves as an introductory platform, offering brief yet informative details on character builds. Due to its status as a prototype, the page currently features limited content, providing information on only a select few characters. However, it lays the groundwork for potential expansion, with the capability to incorporate additional character guides in the future.

Emphasizing functionality and simplicity, the landing page presents users with clear and concise instructions on character optimization. By focusing on key aspects of character development, such as recommended equipment and skill combinations, it aims to assist players in enhancing their gaming experience within Genshin Impact.

While this iteration of the landing page may lack comprehensive character coverage, it serves as a foundation for further development and refinement. As the project evolves, it has the potential to become an invaluable resource for players seeking to maximize the potential of their favorite Genshin Impact characters.

Overall, this project represents a significant step towards the creation of a comprehensive character guide for Genshin Impact, offering a glimpse into its potential as a valuable tool for players navigating the intricacies of character customization and optimization within the game.
